                Solving Near-Fault Data Scarcity Using Earthquake Simulations to Improve Seismic Hazard Analysis of Normal Faults
            </h2>
            <p class="date">August 2024 - present</p>
            <p>
                For my first PhD project, I am analyzing the hazards of normal-faulting
                earthquakes. Because these earthquakes are less common than events of 
                different fault mechanisms, like strike-slip, ground motion data for normal-slip
                events is more scarce. This may have an impact on our current understanding
                of hazards, as hazard models rely on such data.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way to mitigate this issue is by using synthetic data from earthquake simulations.
                In my project, I aim to use <a href="https://seissol.org" target="_blank">SeisSol</a>,
                a software tool for earthquake simulations, to compare the ground motion behaviors
                of normal faults in dynamic rupture simulations with real ground motion data.
            </p>

            <h2>Cracking the Hayward Fault's Recurrence Interval</h2>
            <p class="date">February 2024 - August 2024</p>
            <p>
                For my last undergrad research project at UC Berkeley I developed a
                workflow in a Jupyter Notebook for recreating the Monte Carlo simulation
                of the recurrence interval of the Hayward Fault, as published in
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JB004998" target="_blank">Parsons (2008)</a>.

            <div class="top-row">
                <p style="max-width: 30%;">
                    The goal for this project was to find if the 16-year period since the
                    method had been applied to
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GL035887" target="_blank">the Hayward Fault</a>
                    was statistically significant enough to yield a better fitting value for the
                    recurrence interval. Since the last earthquake on the Fault occurred in 1868
                    <span id="haywardTimer">(over 150 years ago)</span>, and the recurrence interval
                    is thought to be close to that, we considered 16 years to be a statistically
                    significant wait.

                Heartbeat of a Volcano: Detecting Seismicity in the Valles Caldera, 
                New Mexico, Using Machine Learning
            </h2>
            <p class="date">May 2023 - August 2023</p>
            <p>
                This project was my URISE 
                (now known as <a href="https://www.earthscope.org/education/student-internships/resess/" target="_blank">RESESS</a>)
                undergraduate intern project. I developed a Python workflow to analyze geophone
                array records taken in 2019 to assess the level of activity in the Valles Caldera, New Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
                To analyze seismicity in the caldera, I employed Seisbench, a machine learning library for seismic phase
                detection. Using detection models trained on different datasets, we generated P and S wave
                picks which we would use to create a catalogue of earthquakes in the geophone array data.
                However, we found that the geophone data was full of noise from summer thunderstorms in the
                caldera, especially from lightning strikes. While we could not create a comprehensive
                earthquake catalog from this data, we were able to present conclusions about the reliability
                of current machine learning models for earthquake phase picking at AGU.

            <h2>The Earthquake Traffic Light</h2>
            <p class="date">October 2022 - May 2023</p>
            <p>
                My first undergrad research project at UC Berkeley involved creating a workflow for
                analyzing spatiotemporal changes in b-value in the San Francisco Bay Area. We used data
                from the Northern California Seismic Network to calculate b-values in the area dating to 1984.
                The goal of this project was to test a method proposed by
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1606-4" target="_blank">Gulia & Wiemer (2019)</a>
                that would distinguish foreshocks from mainshocks and aftershocks in real time.
                If successful, this method would be useful for assessing real-time hazard analysis
                when a moderately large earthquake occurs, as it would provide a way to determine if a
                mainshock will follow it. However, in our execution, the method proved unsuccessful due to a scarcity of
                sufficiently large (M>6.0) earthquakes in our dataset.
